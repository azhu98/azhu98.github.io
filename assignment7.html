            <h1>Amanda's Final Assignment!</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for my final project!

            <p>
              For my final project, I decided to create a temperature controlled cloud light. I decided </br >
              on this idea for two main reasons. First, I recently stumbled across cloud lamps, as seen </br >
              on the right, that looked super cool. Second, I became slightly obsessed with lighting up </br >
              LEDs using Arduino, especially the multi-coloured ones, due to this class. So I thought, why </br >
              not creat my own variation of a portable cloud lamp that changes colour based on the temperature. <br >
              The cloud lamp can be lit up by standing 20 centimeters or less to it. If it is really cold, </br>
              less than 16 degress celsius, it will turn blue. If it is kind of cold, from 16 to 18 degress </br >
              celsius, it will turn purple. If it is warm, from 18 to 24 degrees celsius, it will turn orange </br >
              Lastly, if it is very warm, higher than 24 degrees celsius, it will turn red. By standing more </br >
              than 20 centimeters from the light, it will turn off.
            </p>

              Here is a video of demonstrating the cloud light in action. </br >

            To recreate my cloud light. You will need the materials listed above. Specifically, <br/ >
            KY-015 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor </br >
            For the cotton, I would suggest purchasing coarser cotton if possible. I went </br >
            with my cotton balls because they were the most reasonable thing I could find.
          </p>

            <img src="A7_Calculations.png" width=600></a>
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are the schematic and justifications for the resistance I chose. For the red </br >
          and green sections of the multicoloured LED, any resistor higher than 85 ohms could </br >
          be used and I chose a 100 ohms resistor. For the blue sections of the multicoloured </br >
          LEDs, any resistor higher than 160 ohns could be used and I chose a 220 ohms resistor.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here is my circuit layout. It consists of two mini breadboards. One with the multicoloured </br >
        LEDs, and another with the temperature and humidity sensor and distance sensor. </br >
        A 9V battery is connected via a DC headjack head battery plug to the Arduino, </br >
        allowing the system to be portable.

        This is the code snippet for the Arduino. It starts by including a temperature and humidity </br >
        sensor library, which you can download and install via the second commented link in the beginning, </br >
        sets appropriate pins for the distance sensor, temperature & humidity sensor, and LED, and </br >
        declare variables. It then sets up the LED and trig pins as outputs, echo pin as input, and initiates </br >
        Serial monitor. Within the loop, it first initiated the distance sensor, reads and calculate the </br >
        detected distance. If the distance sensed is lower than 20 cms, then the temperature sensor senses </br >
        the temperature in celsius and returns the value to the Arduino as an input. If this value is </br >
        > 24 (LEDs = Red); if value is [24, 18) (LEDs = Orange); if value is [18, 16) (LEDs = Purple); </br >
        if values is <= 16 (LEDs = Blue); if distance becomes more than 20 cms, turn all LEDs off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would suggest by connecting the system to the Arduino first before connecting it to a 9V battery, This </br >
        code will output the values to the Serial monitor, allowing you to identify any potential issues. </br >

        The cloud light can be assembled using the following instructions. </br >
        1. Assemble the circuit using the material provided above and ensure the code is working. </br >
        2. Create the cloud container by cutting out a one inch slit on the transparent container. </br >
           This allows the distance sensor to peek through and sense accurate values. Then, loosen </br >
           the cotton balls using hands and glue gun it onto the transparent container as show above. </br>
        3. Once the body of the container is completed. Repeat the same procedure for the exterior </br >
           surface of the container lid. Made slits for the distance sensor if necessary. </br >
        4. Connect the 9v battery, insert your Arduino system into the container and close the lid. </br >
           The cloud light is complete! :)
