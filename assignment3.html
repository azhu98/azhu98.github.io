              This is the Arduino circuit consisting of a white and blue <br/ >
              LED and a photocell sensor.

              This is the circuit in action. It conceptually depicts day <br/ >
              and night. The white LED represents brightness. As the <br/ >
              night falls, the blue LED lights up and gradually dims as <br/ >
              the night deepens. The photocell component tracks the <br/ >
              brightness level. Sample outputs from the operation are <br/ >
              shown below.

            These are the schematic and resistance calculations. 100 ohms <br/ >
            resistors were chosen since they were the closest to the 85 <br/ >
            ohms resistances for the blue and white LEDs. For the photocell <br/ >
            sensor, any resistor above 250 ohms could have been used and a 10K <br/ >
            ohms resistor was chosen to act as a pull-down resistor. Sample <br/>
            calculations at the voltage dividers are demonstrated below the <br/>
            resistor calculations. If I shine a light source directly on the <br/ >
            sensor, the resistance of the photocell could be around 15k ohms; <br/ >
            if my lights are off and it is dark outside, the resistance of the <br/ >
            photocell sensor could be around 180k ohms.

  // converts sensorValue (0 to 1023)
  // into ledValue (0 to 255)
  // dark to bright
  int ledValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  // prints phrase as a line in serial monitor
  Serial.println("ledValue: ");
  // prints integer as a line in serial monitor
  Serial.println(ledValue);
  // changes white LED duty cycle to given value
  analogWrite(WHITE, ledValue);
  // executes if ledValue (duty cycle) is larger or equal to 200
  // ie. bright
  if (ledValue >= 200) {
    // prints phrase as a line in serial monitor
    Serial.println("It's getting bright! Turning blue LED off");
    // turns blue LED off
    analogWrite(BLUE, 0);
  // executed if ledValue (duty cycle) is less than 200
  // ie. not bright
  } else {
    // prints phrase as a line in serial monitor
    Serial.println("It's getting dark! Turning blue LED on");
    // turns blue LED on
    analogWrite(BLUE, ledValue);
  }
  // delays for 100 miliseconds
