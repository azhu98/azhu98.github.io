              This is the Arduino circuit consisting of two green LEDs, a infared system (remote & sensor), <br/ >
              a transistor, and a 300 LEDs long light strip.

              This is the circuit in action. The light strip is controlled by the remote.  Pressing 0 turns the <br/ >
              light strip off, pressing 1 turns the light on, pressing 2 turns the light strip brighter. The <br/ >
              green LEDs symbolize the state of the light strip. With both off representing the off state, one <br/ >
              on representing the "dimmer" state, and two representing the brighter state.<br/ >

            These are the schematic and calculations. <br/ >
            Crucial Points: <br/ >
            1. LEDs: 5 volts are expected as the input and current is expected to be 20 mA. Thus, 220 ohms resistors <br/ >
               were chosen for the green LEDs, since they were the closest to 160 ohms. <br/ >
            2. Before light strip: 12 volts of power is expected as the input. <br/ >
            3. After light strip: I was unable to find a data sheet, but based on similar products and observing its <br/ >
               physical layout, it appears to consist of 100 parallel columns consisting of three 2385 type LEDs and a <br/ >
               181 ohms resistor. Based on research, it appears that 2385 LEDs have a typical voltage drop of 3.2V. <br/ >
               Using this number, I deducted, for each column, the voltage drop will be around 9.6 V. Using this <br/ >
               information, I could then caculate the estimated current for the whole light strip: around 1.3 Amps. <br />
            Current Justification: <br/ >
            Based on the data sheet and per lecture, the maximum current for the transistor is 32 Amps. Based on <br/ >
            my previous calculations, the current flow through the light strip will be around 1.3 Amps, which is way <br/ >
            lower than the transistor's maximum current of 32 Amps, therefore, my current is justified.
